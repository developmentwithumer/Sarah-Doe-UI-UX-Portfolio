# UI/UX Portfolio Website

Welcome to my UI/UX Portfolio Website, a project I created to showcase my web development skills using Next.js. This portfolio features a fictional client, **Sarah Doe**, whose work and design requirements are used as a template to demonstrate my abilities in creating visually appealing and functional websites.

## Project Overview

This website was built to serve as a portfolio, highlighting various aspects of web development and UI/UX design. It is not only a demonstration of design skills but also a showcase of my expertise in coding, structure, and performance optimization using Next.js.
